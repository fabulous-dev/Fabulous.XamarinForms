# Templates for Fabulous.XamarinForms

Fabulous.XamarinForms brings the great development experience of Fabulous to Xamarin.Forms, allowing you to harvest the vast ecosystem of Xamarin.Forms with a tailored declarative UI DSL and clean architecture.

Deploy to any platform supported by Xamarin.Forms, such as Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux and more!

## How to use the templates

Using the dotnet CLI, install the templates:

```sh
dotnet new install Fabulous.XamarinForms.Templates
```

Then, you will be able to create new Fabulous.XamarinForms projects with `dotnet new`:

```sh
dotnet new fabulous-xf -n MyApp
```

If you're using Visual Studio on Windows, prefer the `fabulous-xf-vswin` template instead.

```sh
dotnet new fabulous-xf-vswin -n MyApp
```
